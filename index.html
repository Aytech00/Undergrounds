   <div class="about">
       <h2>Our Story</h2>
       <div class="about-container">
       <p>We get asked the same question by everyone when I share our project. "Who are the developers?" "Who is behind this project?" Of course, everyone wants or expects me to mention some big names or celebrities. Well, with this collection, that's not what you are getting.</p>
       <p>What you are getting is a bunch of nobodies that got sick and tired of seeing the same type of NFT's coming out. Even though most of the artwork was excellent, it seemed to be the same story repeatedly. They would pay and get a project so hyped up and flaunt these "exclusive networking events" and give aways as utilities, but then after the reveal, the floor price would plummet as those who did not get a "rare" one was trying to flip it for a quick profit.Not to mention, most people who get invited to these exclusive parties and events don't even have time off or money to attend.</p>
       <p>Also, let us be honest here…no wealthy and successful person at these events will pay the average person any attention anyways. These should be called "feel good" events, not “networking” events. Another issue we are starting to see more of is after the reveal of collections, not only does the floor price seem to plummet, but the project also seems to die and fade away. In our opinion, after the reveal is when you go to the next level with the project, marketing, etc. Anyone can pay and get a project hyped to sell out, but not everyone can keep a project alive. </p>
       <p>Those bad experiences led us to create an NFT for the people. An NFT that is exclusive and would bring real value to its holders and potentially change someone's life. Something unique to where the floor price was not such a crucial component of the project’s success, and something exciting for its holders. Something that didn't piggyback off other NFTs with exclusive events and the Metaverse. Something known as The Underground.</p>
       <p>The Underground is an exclusive supply of 2,500 ETH-designed NFT's that shares secondary sales with the holders through giving back in Ethereum based on the rarity of the NFT. What is also unique about this project is that the potential return continues to grow as ETH prices increase! Our sole goal with this collection is to create opportunities to give back to the holders, change as many lives as we can, and to truly make a difference. We welcome you to share this opportunity with us and the NFT for the people as this is just the beginning.</p>

                <p>There is a total of 2,500 ETH coin NFTs released. Pricing for the NFT will be 1 ETH + gas fees.</p>

                <p> 
                  This is to ensure we are attracting those who are serious in this project and what it stands for. We recognize the minting price is high, but we have a limited supply of 2,500 in the collection. We will also be giving out 5 bronze coins to selected members in the discord that could not mint. If we were to increase the supply, the payouts at the end of the year would decrease significantly.

            <div class="accordion__question"> 
                <p>What if I own a couple of each variation? Will I still get the payout for each?</p> 
            </div> 
            <div class="accordion__answer"> 
                <p>Yes! Each coin gets a specific pay out per the utilities, so if you have a couple of each, you will still get all the respected amounts!</p> 
            </div> 
        </div> 

        <div class="accordion"> 
            <div class="accordion__question"> 
                <p>How will pay out work? How do you know who owns what?</p>

            <div class="accordion__answer"> 
                <p> 
                  Pay outs will be deposited into the respected accounts exactly 1 year following the sellout of minting through ETH transfers. We will have a wallet verification set up to prove ownership prior to disbursement.<br>The true value of payout is unknown because you may hold your payout in ETH and let it grow as ETH price increases! Or you may sell and cash in $ or fund your next NFT adventure!

            <div class="accordion__question"> 
                <p>How will we know what is in the community wallet? </p> 
            </div> 
            <div class="accordion__answer"> 
                <p> 
                We will have the balance of the community wallet posted in here once we are live. One thing to note is that you would be able to know what your payout is at that given time, so you would essentially know what your NFT coin is worth if you wanted to list it. Example: Say one month after minting is completed you have a black coin NFT and the wallet is at 500K. That would tell me that with the utilities of the black coin pay out, you would split 5% of the community wallet with the other holder resulting in $12,500 at that point in time. So, if you wanted to list it, you know you could list it at $12,500. A buyer could potentially see where its current value is and want to buy and keep it for the remaining of the year for the payout. Not to mention, as ETH increases, so does the community wallet!
